Quality of Life

Custom sound file support — let users pick their own .wav files beyond C:\Windows\Media
Volume control — adjustable volume slider in the tray menu
Cooldown timer — avoid repeated notifications if Claude sends multiple short responses quickly
Notification modes — toast notification, flash taskbar, or both alongside audio
Power User

Auto-start with Windows — optional registry/startup folder integration
Per-window tracking — support multiple Claude Desktop windows simultaneously
Quiet hours / Do Not Disturb — schedule times when notifications are suppressed
Different sounds for different events — e.g., one sound for short responses, another for long ones
Monitoring & Reliability

Status indicator in tray icon — change the icon color/overlay to show if Claude is streaming, idle, or disconnected
Response time tracking — small log or tooltip showing how long Claude took to respond
Auto-reconnect — if Claude Desktop is restarted, automatically re-attach without user intervention (you may already handle this in your state machine)
Integration

Webhook / HTTP callback — fire a GET/POST when Claude finishes, enabling external automations
Global hotkey — e.g., bring Claude Desktop to foreground with a keyboard shortcut
Polish

First-run onboarding — a small dialog explaining setup on first launch
Update checker — check GitHub releases for new versions
Which of these interest you? I can help plan and implement any of them.
